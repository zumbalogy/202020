Looking at screens all day can be bad for your eyes.

This website reminds you via sounds and graphs to follow the 202020 rule.

202020 rule: every 20 mins of looking at a screen, look 20ft away for 20sec.
Addionally, blink* a lot and maybe close eyes a bit.

Can also help clear mind, and keep track of how much time is passing.

IIRC, People blink 14 times a min about, but less than 10 while reading or screen watching.
